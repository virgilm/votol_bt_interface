# Bluetooth interface for Votol Controllers

Arduino code for a CAN &lt;-> BT interface for Votol controllers.

This will work on a very specific hardware (based on ESP32), as described in this [project](https://github.com/virgilm/votol_tuner_hardware)

# Tested good setup as of Sept 2024

## Install Arduino IDE version 2.3.3
Other versions might work

## Libraries
Under Tools->Manage Libraries, add the following:

### arduino-CAN install this specific library due to a bug
https://github.com/avlasic/arduino-CAN/tree/patch-1
(fork from https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-CAN ver 0.3.1)

### EspSoftwareSerial (v8.1.0 - latest)

from https://github.com/plerup/espsoftwareserial/

## Board Selection
Under Tools->Boards Manager, add the following board

### ESP32 by Espressif Systems version 2.0.17
Version 3.x has a different way to deal with watchdogs at a minimum - needs investigation!
from https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32

## Load sketch (metahack.ino)

File -> Open

## Select board/port

E.g. ESP32 Dev Module, /dev/cu.usbserial-0001 Serial Port (USB)

## Succesful connection/init

Set USB serial baud rate to 250000 baud.

A normal init sequence should look like this:

RED LED will turn ON when power is applied

Serial Console should say

```
Serial init ok!
WiFi disabled!
CAN init ok!
BT init ok!
```

BLUE LED will turn ON and start blinking when BT connection with the app is established.
